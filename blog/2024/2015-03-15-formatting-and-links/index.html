The benefits of BCG vaccination extend far beyond offering protection against TB and have been found to reduce risk for serious infections resulting in deaths or hospitalizations from unrelated infections; called non-specific or pathogen-agnostic effects of the BCG vaccine. These pathogen-agnostic effects are especially powerful when BCG is given to newborns, who are at exceptionally high risk to die of infectious diseases; BCG-vaccinated newborns in low resource settings have half the risk to die compared to unvaccinated newborns. These effects involve the way that the BCG vaccine alters innate immunity. BCG induces a process called “trained immunity”, which epigenetically reprograms stem cells in the bone marrow to give rise to monocytes that are “trained” to mount a more robust inflammatory response to unrelated stimuli. In newborns, our team discovered that BCG also induces a process called “emergency granulopoiesis (EG)”, or a rapid production of mature neutrophils, which are then able to rapidly clear invading microbes. EG explains the beneficial pathogen-agnostic effects of BCG vaccination in newborns. The cytokine Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) initiates EG.</p> <h4 id="hipster-list">Hipster list</h4> <ul> <li>brunch</li> <li>fixie</li> <li>raybans</li> <li>messenger bag</li> </ul> <h4 id="check-list">Check List</h4> <ul class="task-list"> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked>Brush Teeth</li> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled>Put on socks <ul class="task-list"> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked>Put on left sock</li> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled>Put on right sock</li> </ul> </li> <li class="task-list-item"> <input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled checked>Go to school</li> </ul> <p>Hoodie Thundercats retro, tote bag 8-bit Godard craft beer gastropub.
